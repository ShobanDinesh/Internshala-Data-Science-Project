This repository contains the files of Internshal Data Science Training Project.

The Problem statement is explained in the pdf in the repo.

While the Benchmark notebook is the notebook provided in the course, 'My Solution' notebook contains my solution to the problem. 

The Data folder contains the solution checker, it displays the accuracy score for the test dataset. While the model developed in the Benchmark solution's accuracy is 90%, 
the model that I developed has the accuracy score of 91%. The data in the 'My Solution' is preprocessed differently.
